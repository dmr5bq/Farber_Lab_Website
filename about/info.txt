About Section Explanation
-------------------------

The about section consists of two pseudo-models, called AboutSection and Project, respectively. These pseudo-models are
PHP classes that contain fields and method related to the reading, creation, display and editing of the content. The
following standards have to be adhered to for the models to work. These objects are not stored in the database due to
their unique natures and lengths of their data. Instead, they are stored within the filesystem of the site itself to
improve speed.

To add an AboutSection:
1. open sections.txt in the data/about dir
2. add a line with the format <display_name>+:<link_name>
3. create a <link_name>.txt file in the data/about dir
4. in this file, enter the section text or HTML and *SAVE*
5. reload the about page to see changes

About Section
-> link_name
    - must be set equal to the filename w/o extension of a .txt file stored in the data/about dir
    - the entire contents of the file will be stored into the AboutSection's text_data field; this field should never
        be edited directly
-> display_name
    - this represents the section title

To add a Project:
1. open the projects.txt file in the data/about/projects dir
2. add a link with the format <display_name>:+<link_name>
3. add a thumbnail image (must be a PNG) to the assets dir with name <link_name>.png
4. create a <link_name>.txt file in the data/about/projects dir
5. enter a short description for the project preview
6. press ENTER, type three hyphens "---" and hit ENTER again
7. enter a longer description for the project page
8. SAVE the files and reload the about page to see changes
