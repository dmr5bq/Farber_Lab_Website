We are using RNAi in primary calvarial osteoblasts and transgenic and conditional knockout mice to study the role of genes identified in project #1. Our efforts are primarily focused on understanding the function of Bicadual C1 homolog (Bicc1) in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone mass (Farber CR et al. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research. 2009).
