                <p class="body-text">Systems genetics seeks to understand how genetic information is integrated, organized and transmitted through cellular networks to impact cellular function/behavior. Much of our work in the lab uses systems genetics approaches that integrate genetic and transcriptome data to identify individual genes and gene networks influencing complex skeletal phenotypes. </p></td>
